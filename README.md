Air pollution is a global threat impacting health, the environment, and quality of life, driven by urbanization, industrialization, and vehicle emissions. Harmful pollutants like PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂, and O₃ are linked to serious health issues. This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of air quality data from various locations and time periods to uncover patterns, trends, anomalies, and pollution hotspots. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis offers insights to support environmental policies, modeling, and health interventions through a data-driven approach.
